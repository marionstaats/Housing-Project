## Mission objectives
Creating an app for the Sales team working for a Housing Company called "ImmoEliza". The R&D/AI department just finished creating an API allowing to predict the price of a house. They are really happy with the workings of this app but they need it to be used in a the case of a web-app for the sales team to use.

The app will be quite simple. It only needs Two things.
First. A form. The form will be for the user two complete with informations about the house.
This form will be connected to the API.
The second thing is way to display the results.
